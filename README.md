Use Case - I wanted to explore torch audio in an interactive sound-scape generation tool. It uses PyTorch to capture . It also performs a Fast Fourier Transform to capture the individual partials of the speaker/singer's voice and allows you to select them. There are lots of tools to build on this synthesis with rhythmic layers, panning,
and other artifacts.
To run, pull the code, install the requirements, and run app.py. Make sure you have a mic available.
